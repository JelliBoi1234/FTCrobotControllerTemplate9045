Create a folder for the path based either on the tools it uses or who is making it.
Ex: ClawFourBar or BobAllice
Copy the Template into the folder under a creative name describing what it does
Ex: DriveInASquareMeepMeep
Copy the corresponding drive constants file, if you have one, into said folder
Make the MeepMeep class extend it, and put the values into necissary places
If you aren't using positioning sensors, such as a camera, adding a robot_length variable could help for starting positions
